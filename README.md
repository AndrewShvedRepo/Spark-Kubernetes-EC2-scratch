![enter image description here](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1920/1*dExybAJeomHZxzWaMA6rAQ.png)
> Spark can run on clusters managed by Kubernetes. This feature makes use of native Kubernetes scheduler that has been added to Spark.

The goals of this learning project are:
 1. Set up Kubernetes cluster on AWS (EC2) from scratch
 2. Run basic Apache Spark jobs on Kubernetes cluster
 3.  Compare and contrast cost, performance and other tradeoffs of
	 - Apache Spark on [Amazon EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/)  - YARN
	 - Apache Spark with [AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/) - serverless processing
	 - Apache Spark on Kubernetes Cluster
